# About the game
I made this game in high school a couple years back. It's built entirely with Java. 
The game is a 2D multiplayer deathmatch game where the objective is to use your spells
to eliminate your opponents. Upon joining a server you spawn in the town which is a safe place where you can talk to
eachother using the message box. There is a transporter guy that can teleport you to the big arena where you can kill eachother
freely.

TODO:

Chat bubbles:
 in playerMP do some string function (rendering) and display it on screen, if the same person says another thing while the string is rendered,
 delete that and render the new one. Maybe with an array list? Maybe with a simple boolean? 
 Call the function from the client (update Chat) 

 Settings window in-game:
 Enable music,
 enable stuff like: display health regeneration or mana regeneration etc. 
 save these settings in a text file for future purposes. 
 
 Make a nicer map?
